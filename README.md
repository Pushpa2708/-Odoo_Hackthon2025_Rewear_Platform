# 👕 ReWear – Sustainable Fashion Swap Platform

> ⚠️ This is a **Hackathon prototype** built for the [Odoo Hackathon 2025](https://www.odoo.com/event/odoo-hackathon-2025-7644/register). The project is still **incomplete** but reflects the core concept, UI flow, and direction.

## 🌱 Project Description

**ReWear** is a fashion-sharing platform where users can:

- Upload pre-loved clothing items
- Earn or spend points to swap clothes with others
- Promote sustainability by reducing textile waste

The platform aims to create a **community-powered wardrobe system** where people can refresh their style without spending money or hurting the environment.
